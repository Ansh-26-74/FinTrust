## üß† Core Technologies

- **Spring Boot**
- **MongoDB** (NoSQL database)
- **Redis** (in-memory store for tokens, PINs, and locks)
- **Spring Security** with **JWT**
- **Java MailSender** for email notifications
- **BCrypt** for secure password storage

---

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### üîê Authentication & Authorization

- ‚úÖ Separate **User and Admin registration/login**
- ‚úÖ **JWT-based authentication**
    - Stateless login system
    - Role-based access control (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`)
- ‚úÖ **BCrypt password hashing** for secure storage
- ‚úÖ **Session PIN System**
    - 4‚Äì6 digit PIN generated on login
    - Sent via email and stored temporarily in Redis
    - Used for sensitive operations

---

### üîÅ Session PIN System

- ‚úÖ Required for sensitive operations (e.g., listing users as admin)
- ‚úÖ PIN is:
    - Stored in Redis with 30-minute TTL
    - Auto-deleted upon logout
    - Verified before performing secure tasks

---

### üîí Password Reset System

- ‚úÖ **Forgot Password Flow:**
    - Accepts email
    - Generates secure token
    - Stores token in Redis
    - Sends reset link via email
- ‚úÖ **Reset Password Flow:**
    - Token verification
    - Accepts new password
    - Password is hashed and saved in MongoDB
- ‚úÖ Applicable for both users and admins

---

### ‚ö† Suspicious Activity Detection & User Lock

- ‚úÖ Tracks login attempts using Redis key: `FAILED_LOGIN:{username}`
- ‚úÖ On **3 failed attempts**:
    - Admin notified via email
    - Email contains a secure link to lock the user
- ‚úÖ **Admin Lock Endpoint:**
    - `POST /api/admin/lock-user/{username}`
- ‚úÖ Lock Mechanism:
    - Locked users cannot log in
    - Lock expires automatically after 15 minutes (handled via Redis TTL)
    - Unlock handled automatically after duration passes
